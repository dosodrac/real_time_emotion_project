# Real-time Convolutional Neural Networks for Emotion Classification - final year project (2021)

In this project intend to implement a deep learning real time facial recognition and emotion classification program. To achieve this, I will use Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) for training from a dataset and real-time computer vision from a webcam. The proposal of this project is a facial emotion analysis, in real time, on participants presented with a dataset of videos, and subsequent accurate categorising of the emotions produced by each element in the dataset. 
The sequential process will be delineated in three distinct phases; the first phase, where a human face is detected through the webcam, the second phase where the input is examined on the features with support of a CNN model and the third phase where the human face is classified as an emotion such as anger, disgust, happiness, fear, neutral, sadness or surprise. 

This repository will be updated along the journey.
